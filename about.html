            <div><p>
                My name is Hayley and I'm a computer science student at the University of pretoria. From the moment I wrote my first line of code at the age of 13, I was drawn to the mesmerizing world of programming.
                The essence of coding, for me, lies in its logic. It's the art of breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable pieces and meticulously crafting solutions that fit together like the pieces of a puzzle.
                Every line of code I write is a testament to my love for the logical reasoning that underpins it. I relish the challenge of finding elegant and efficient solutions, of optimizing algorithms, and of thinking critically to
                tackle even the most daunting of tasks. The process of coding is not just about making things work; it's about making them work brilliantly.
                Coding isn't just a skill; it's a passion that fuels my curiosity, sharpens my analytical thinking, and constantly challenges me to evolve.
                It's a journey where every line of code is a step forward, every problem is an opportunity, and every solution is a source of pride.

                                The mental fortitude I've developed in this pursuit has transcended into other areas of my life, making me more resilient, focused, and determined.
